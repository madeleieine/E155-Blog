## Introduction
Lab 7 uses the MCU and the FPGA together to perform encryption on a 128-bit long string according to AES-128. There, the FPGA serves an accelerator for the 10 rounds of encryption. Information is communicated between the MCU and the FPGA over SPI.

## Schematic
The circuit diagram is as follows:

## Code:

## Results
The lab worked as expected! Below are some oscilloscope traces, annotated with the desired vs actual frequency. Note that all are within 1% of the desired frequency
