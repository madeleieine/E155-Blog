## Introduction
The purpose of Lab3 was to develop a scanner to read two inputs from a keypad and display them on a seven-segment display.

## Schematic
The circuit diagram is as follows:

The calculations for the current-limiting resistors are as follows:

## Block Diagram
Here is the block diagram for the overall software architecture:

Here is the ScanFSM state transition diagram:

Here is the DebounceFSM state transition diagram:

## Code:
Here is the code implementation of the system described above:
```systemverilog
lab3_top.sv
```

```systemverilog
counter.sv
```

```systemverilog
scan_fsm.sv
```

```systemverilog
debounce_fsm.sv
```

```systemverilog
led_processor.sv
```

```systemverilog
led_driver.sv
```

```systemverilog
mux.sv
```

```systemverilog
seven_segment_display.sv
```

## Results
Unfortunately, the hardware design did not work. However, the simulations did work! Here are the waveforms:

## Summary
I have so far spent like 26 hours on this lab. I learned a lot about synchrounous design and partitioning complicated tasks into simultaneous finite state machines.
