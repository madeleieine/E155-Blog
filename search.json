The resistor values of 330 Ohms I chose resulted in a current draw of 3.93 mA, which is less than the recommended range of 5mA-20mA, but the diodes still shone visibly while remaining well under the maximum allowed current of 20 mA. While different from what I ended up doing, 100 Ohm resistors could be used to yield a current of (1.3V/100 Ohms) = 13 mA, which is within the recommended operating range of the 7-segment display."

    "text": "Reflection\nReflection before lab regrade:\nThis lab met all but one proficiency requirement, as specified in the Lab 1 spec sheet. The missing proficiency requirement is due to the missing 5V regulator and SMT diodes, which were not available in the digital lab at the time of completion. I will find and solder these on during the next week.\nIn terms of the excellence requirements, I provide calculations to show how to maintain the current draw in each diode of the seven-segment display within the recommended operating conditions of 5-20 mA. However, this differs slightly from what I ended up doing. This is because I noticed that the 3.3V output from my PCB was not working as intended; originally, it was outputting 1.4 V instead of 3.3V. I worked with Abe to attach a 3.3V regulator, but then the output started yielding &lt;1V. During this time, I decided to supply the seven-segment display with 5V, thus necessitating the higher resistor value. Later, I moved the entire circuit from the PCB to the breadboard, so I was able to use the 3.3V power source again. However, since I was limited on time, I did not change the resistors back from 330 Ohms to ~100 Ohms. Next week, I will be sure to start the lab earlier and schedule more time to work on it so I can perform more thorough organized work.\nThe other excellence requirement I did not meet was the QuestaSim automatic testbench requirement. I started working on a testbench and testvector for seven_segment_display.sv, but I ran into difficulty with reading in the test vectors, and I unfortunately ran out of time to debug this.\nWhile I didnâ€™t get to complete automated testbenches myself before the check-in time, I did help some peers debug their testbenches, and I have a sense of how I would approach simulating my code for future labs.\nReflection post updating lab for regrade\nThis lab meets all proficiency and excellence specifications. The main issues I ran into were as follows:\n\nHardware issues with the 3.3V regulator\nFirmware issues; I forgot to (re)set the top-level module, so the 3 led pins ended up not being driven. This could be seen in the pin assignment window. Since the pins werenâ€™t being driven, they were at 3.3V as a default, but this voltage dropped to 1.8V when the pin was connected to the LED. To fix this, I had to go under the project menu and set the appropriate module as the top-level module and resyntesize.\nThe testbench couldnâ€™t read the testvector file; this was remedied by referencing the absolute path of the testvector file (rather than the relative path)."

Take full advantage of SystemVerilog syntax, for example, using logic instead of wire and reg.\nIt generated the following code, accompanied by a high-leve overview of how the clk frequency is customized:\nmodule led_blinker (\n    input logic clk,      // High-speed clock (e.g., 12 MHz)\n    output logic led      // LED output (blinking at 2 Hz)\n);\n\n    // Define a parameter for clock frequency and target frequency for blinking\n    parameter integer HIGH_SPEED_CLK_FREQ = 12000000;  // 12 MHz internal oscillator\n    parameter integer TARGET_FREQ = 1; // 1 Hz (for 2 Hz blinking)\n    \n    // Calculate the division factor (this depends on the input clock and target frequency)\n    localparam integer DIVIDE_FACTOR = HIGH_SPEED_CLK_FREQ / (TARGET_FREQ * 2); // Divide by 2 for full period\n\n    // Counter to divide the clock frequency\n    logic [31:0] counter;  // Counter to keep track of clock cycles\n\n    // Clock divider and LED toggle logic\n    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n        if (counter &lt; DIVIDE_FACTOR - 1) begin\n            counter &lt;= counter + 1;\n        end else begin\n            counter &lt;= 0;\n            led &lt;= ~led; // Toggle LED state on every period of the divided clock\n        end\n    end\n\nendmodule\nThe code did synthesize on the first try, which was good, and the description would have been helpful if customizing the frequency of a clock signal in system verilog was completely new to me. However, one issue is that ChatGPT hardcoded the internal clk frequency, and it didnâ€™t actually interface with the Lattice UP5K HSOSC. It also did not include any resources where users could find information about the Lattice UP5K HSOSC, like the official documentation. Additionally, it doesnâ€™t really talk about how the size of the counter vector (N) or the constant that is added to counter every clock cylce (p) can be adjusted to derive a desired clock frequencyâ€“it basically assumes that the only way to create a clock signal with a desired frequency is to find an internal clock that is already some power of 2 of that frequency. When I was writing the code to get an LED to blink at 2.4 Hz, I found reading the documentation for the HSOSC, referencing the formula for f_PWM from the E85 textbook, and referencing my old E85 code to be the most helpful. All three of these resources provided valuable information not covered by ChatGPTâ€™s first response. If I were to use AI in my workflow, I would try to research what Iâ€™m trying to accomplish so that I can tune my prompt to get more valuable and detailed information."

    "text": "2-3 para reflection\nThis blog was an eye-opening experience for sure. While my friends from the class warned me that it might take a while, I didnâ€™t really internalize what they said. I ended up mismanaging my time, pushing off a lot of the work to the last minute, and ultimately not completing the testvectors. Moving forward, I will do my best to schedule 20 hours for each lab in the days leading up to the check-off date so I donâ€™t have to scramble in the same way. I definitely focus better when Iâ€™m well-rested, and I think getting into a good work routine will be helpful (especially when the swim season starts).\nI do think I enjoyed the lab. It felt like a review of the engineering skills I have learned so far, both in E85 with SystemVerilog programming, and from E80 and Clinic with soldering (and de-soldering). It was nice to get to review a variety of these skills all in one lab, and I feel prepared to take on lab 2.\nI didnâ€™t get to the test benches on my first try at the lab (due to aforementioned time management issues), but I am working on that now for the regrade. Between taking E85 a year ago and MicroPs now, I worked a bit on developing a testbench for an astronomical random number generator in the physics lab I research with. It was different from E85 since it used Verilog and a different IDE, but it was exciting to see a real-world application of E85 skills. Another exciting thing in lecture was when prof. Spencer gave an example of a synchronous design challenge, and it was very similar to the project I was working on two summers ago in that same lab! Overall, I am really excited about the applications of computer engineering, and I canâ€™t wait to develop my sills."
