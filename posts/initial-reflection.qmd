Firstly, I am hopen to work on developing my FPGA and MCU programming skills. Additionally, I want
to work on my technical documentation and communication skills. I also want to work on project design,
execution, and evaluation! Overall, I am excited to build a project that I find interesting and
learn a lot of useful skills along the way.
